# Introduction
FPEAM calculates air pollutants from agricultural activities and transportation associated with production of biomass for renewable energy.

Pollutants included are: CH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>x</sub>, VOC, PM2.5, PM10

## Code structure
FPEAM is organized into modules that calculate pollutant emissions from a particular activity category. Each module is described further in its own section.

* MOVES: Off-farm, on-road transportation of biomass to biorefineries.
* NONROAD: On-farm use of agricultural equipment.  Includes emissions from fuel combustion and equipment operation.
* Chemical: Emissions from volatilization of nitrogenous fertilizers, herbicides and insecticides.
* FugitiveDust: Fugitive dust (PM2.5 and PM10) emissions from on-farm transportation.

Config files are used for each module. Values in config files 


# MOVES Module

## User options (basic)
These are user options accessible with the built-in FPEAM GUI.

## User options (advanced)
These are user options that must be set directly in the moves.ini config file.
