    Comment: The function CombustionEmissions._getDescription() was being called before
    NH3 conversions were done. In this funciton it would set new values to these constants
    only in the corn grain feed stock, and never convert the constants back to their normal
    numbers. So the model would only run correctly if corn grain was ran last. Now the 
    run codes can be used in any order.
